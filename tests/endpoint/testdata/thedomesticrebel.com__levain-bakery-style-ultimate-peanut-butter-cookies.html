<p>These <strong>Levain Bakery-Style Peanut Butter Cookies</strong> are seriously AWESOME. Although Levain Bakery does not make a peanut butter cookie, these are made Levain Bakery-style &#8211; ultra thick, a whopping 6-ounces each and SUPER peanut buttery!</p><div class="6f1bca67d118eaa5c44a994b318ddfab" data-index="1" style="float: none; margin:10px 0 10px 0; text-align:center;">

<p>Even if you&#8217;ve never been to the famed Levain Bakery in NYC, I am sure you&#8217;ve heard of it. They&#8217;re known for their huge 6-ounce each cookies in four flavors: <a href="https://thedomesticrebel.com/2020/06/17/authentic-levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-walnut-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Chip Walnut</a>, <a href="https://thedomesticrebel.com/2020/06/22/authentic-levain-bakery-dark-chocolate-chip-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Chocolate Chip</a>, <a href="https://thedomesticrebel.com/2020/06/15/authentic-levain-bakery-chocolate-peanut-butter-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip</a>, and <a href="https://thedomesticrebel.com/2020/06/24/authentic-levain-bakery-oatmeal-raisin-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oatmeal Raisin</a>. Lucky for you, I&#8217;ve made all those flavors into copycats, as well as my Levain-style version of a <a href="https://thedomesticrebel.com/2020/08/12/levain-bakery-style-funfetti-cake-batter-sugar-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Funfetti cookie</a> and a <a href="https://thedomesticrebel.com/2021/03/01/levain-bakery-style-red-velvet-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Velvet</a> one! And now, I&#8217;ve made this peanut butter version!</p>
<p>Levain Bakery cookies are amazing when you&#8217;re visiting NYC, and while they do ship nationwide, it is very expensive last I checked. Why spend all that money when you can make a seriously authentic tasting bakery-style cookie at home in under an hour? No joke!</p>

<p>Here are a few key components to making Levain-style cookies, and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cornstarch: </strong>Cornstarch is my number 1 favorite cookie ingredient for yielding soft and tender cookies every single time. I love the light texture it gives cookies!</li>
<li><strong>Cake flour: </strong>Cake flour is Levain&#8217;s secret weapon for their massive cookies that have a tender crumb and a lighter texture, despite being so huge in size. If all all-purpose flour was to be used, these cookies would be very dense, almost like a scone. But by using half all-purpose flour and half cake flour, they are surprisingly lighter and more tender.</li>
<li><strong>Brief chill-time: </strong>These cookies are chilled for a maximum of 15 minutes for optimal results. We&#8217;ll only bake one sheet of cookies at a time, so while the small batch of cookies bakes, just keep the rest of the cookie dough refrigerated.</li>
<li><strong>Extra mix-ins: </strong>Do not be alarmed by the quantity of mix-ins in this cookie recipe! In order to maintain the structure of the cookie, 3.5 cups of mix-ins is required. Not only do the mix-ins help support the structure of the cookie, but they also add flavor and help prevent too much spreading.</li>
</ul>

<p>And for optimal baking results, follow these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape: </strong>I like to shape these cookie dough balls rough and loose. Normally, we&#8217;d use a cookie dough scoop and get tight, smooth, compact balls of cookie dough. But for this recipe, I like craggy, rougher texture and a looser pack which gives better texture. For accuracy, I like measuring out 6 ounces of dough precisely using a digital cooking scale.</li>
<li><strong>Size: </strong>These cookies are very large at a whopping 6 ounces apiece each, so I recommend only baking 4 per baking sheet and staggering them on the baking sheet so they have plenty of room for when they bake &#8211; at least 3&#8243; from one another. This staggered pattern on the baking sheet helps prevent them from forming one giant cookie in the baking process and keeps baking consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Do not over-bake!: </strong> Levain&#8217;s cookies are notoriously underbaked and gooey in the center and that&#8217;s our goal here as well, too! While everyone&#8217;s oven&#8217;s operate differently, generally your cookies will bake in the timeframe of 10-13 minutes. Mine baked at exactly 11:30. The cookies should have a light golden brown color on the outside and a dry, dull exterior but will be gooey and slightly underbaked in the center. I recommend baking 1 cookie dough ball in the center of a baking sheet first to gauge how quickly yours will bake as a test cookie before baking the rest of the batch. Remember, we&#8217;re only baking one sheet of cookies at a time in the center rack of the oven for consistency, and do keep in mind that the cookies will finish cooking up on the baking sheets once removed from the oven.</li>
<li><strong>One at a time: </strong>For best results, bake the 4 cookies per baking sheet, one baking sheet in the center rack of the oven at a time!</li>
</ul>

I like to make my cookie dough balls kind of tall as well. You do not want the dough balls to be smooth and compacted. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough balls, staggering on the baking sheet at least 3&quot; apart from one another, and only placing 4 dough balls per baking sheet. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-21772-step-0-4" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">Bake one baking sheet at a time in the center rack of the oven for 10-13 minutes or until the tops are light golden brown and the exterior is dry and dull looking. Centers will be slightly underdone and gooey; this is okay and the cookies will finish cooking some once removed from the oven. Let stand on the baking sheets for at least 30 minutes before serving; the cookies are very delicate and fragile once removed from the oven and need time to set before being moved. Keep remaining dough refrigerated while other cookies bake.</span></div></li></ul></div></div>

This recipe is great! Really easy and super delicious. I did sub 1c of chocolate chips for one of the cups of PB chips. I also don’t have a scale, so I just used a large kitchen spoon. The dough balls ended up being about 1/4c in size, yielding 16 cookies. I baked them at the 410 temp for 8min until they were “light golden brown and exterior was dull/dry looking.” After waiting the 30min for them to cool on the pans, my husband and I tasted, and 10/10 will make these deliciously doughy cookies again!</p>

Shut up, these are incredible! Great recipe and totally delivers on PB flavor. I sprinkled a little salt on the cookies halfway through and that bumps up the flavor even more. Thanks for sharing!</p>

<p>All of your Levain cookie recipes look so flippin&#8217; good, especially this one!! They look sooooo dangerous that I&#8217;m afraid to make them! ? Do you think it might turn out well if you put in pieces of Reese&#8217;s cups? ??</p>

Amazing cookies! I did change the mix ins a smidge &#8211; I use (1) bag of PB chips, (1) 4 oz movie theater box of Reese’s Pieces and (1) 7.6 oz bag of Reese’s minis. Best PB cookies ever!</p>

These were excellent. I subbed peanuts for the Reese&#8217;s Pieces, and they were still plenty sweet. Great recipe!</p>

These were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had, bought, made in my entire life! I am a huge peanut butter connoisseur. Currently I have 27 different kinds of peanut butter in my kitchen! I made these last weekend for the first time in my family and I ate them up in two days. Just stocked up on ingredients to make more this weekend. Honestly this is the best recipe in the world.</p>

These were SO good! Love how detailed the recipe is and they turned out delicious!!! My oven might run a little hot because 8 mins was good for me. 12/10 would recommend!</p>

<p>Excited to try these! If I wanted to make these cookies smaller than 6 oz (like a regular cookie size), would I still cook these on 410 degrees and for how long? I realize that the texture probably will be different because they won&#8217;t be as gooey inside but 6 oz is a big cookie for me 🙂</p>

The best peanut butter cookies ever! I didn&#8217;t have cake flower, so I &#8220;made&#8221; some by taking 1 cup of all purpose flower, removing 2 TBS of flour and adding in 2 TBS of cornstarch. These came out amazing!</p>

<p>Hi Jillia! A couple of things: was real butter used, or margarine? Margarine would cause spreading. Was your baking soda fresh? Even if it was still good on the expiration date, if it hasn&#8217;t been used in awhile, it could have gone bad and that would cause spreading as well.</p>

If you love peanut butter, these are for you. They turned out perfect, which is unusual for me. I love super soft cookies. Ten minutes and they were just right. I will make these again!</p>

I made these following the directions except they stayed in the fridge for about 8 hours. No time to bake them sooner. They are really good, but the funny thing is that they don&#8217;t really taste like peanut butter cookies. 🤷‍♀️ The picture makes them look darker than they really are. 😊</p>

<p>Do you think it would work if I substituted butterfinger bits (in the baking aisle) for the reese&#8217;s pieces? That is what they had at my grocery store, and I&#8217;m wondering if that would still give the batter something to grip onto as well as the reese&#8217;s pieces. I did find the peanutbutter chips, so I will still have those to add in as well. I&#8217;m really looking forward to trying these!</p>
