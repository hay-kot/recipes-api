Over hours of simmering, all the flavors meld together and the ingredients soften to tenderness.\n\n\n<b>How to Thicken Beef Stew:</b> Starches, like the flour and potato in this recipe, thicken beef stew. Here, beef cubes are coated in flour, then browned, leaving flour in the pan while sealing flour to the meat. When the meat is later simmered, that flour thickens the liquid as do potatoes, which release their starches as they cook.\n\n\n<b>How to Make Beef Stew on the Stove:</b> It's important to cook stew slowly over low heat. High heat will cause the meat to tighten and toughen, while low heat allows the meat to become fall-apart tender. Simply cover the pot and keep the heat as low as it goes.\n\n\n<b>What to Serve With Beef Stew:</b> The best <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/44373459-easy-side-dishes\">accompaniments</a> to beef stew can soak up the sauce.

I also caramelize two yellow onions and add those. Reserve 1/4 fresh chopped onion to saute. Herbs de Provence and smoked paprika are a must. Double the wine :) I like the idea of adding tomato paste, will try that.

For a more robust sauce, after browning the beef batches and deglazing the pan, I included 2 teaspoons of worcestershire sauce and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of thyme to the liquids.

She's gone now, but I would give anything to eat this with her one more time."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lisa Conn"},"reviewBody":"This was delicious.  I cubed a chuck roast which was cheap and flavorful (removing all excess fat).  I added some worchestershire sauce and ketchup at the end to add umami (flavor). After cooking I separated the solids and boiled the liquid a bit to reduce and concentrate, then whisked in a slurry of flour and water to thicken before recombining with meat and veggies.  This stew is a one pot meal.  It doesn't require rice or noodles because of the large amount of potatoes."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jack Wilson"},"reviewBody":"I think many of the negative comments were from people who have no idea what an old time stew tasted like. They probably have McDonald's taste buds and there is no changing that. This was a wonderful stew. With that said I also added to it. My choice was worcester sauce from my Brittish background. Adapting a recipe to fit your own taste is a normal procedure. Perhaps if some of these who commented threw in a Quarte pounder they would have felt differently."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bob davison"},"reviewBody":"Two great Irish cooks rated this the best beef stew they ever tasted.

Then make the stew as shown here. She thickens the gravy at the end by adding miller's butter (half butter and half flour) rolled into little balls, one at a time, until it's as thick as you like.  I agree with her."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Diana"},"reviewBody":"Sautéed onion and a shallot, added to deglazed pot with browned meat and a few sprigs of thyme.

If you're making a big pot, shank is about half the price of chuck!"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"MT"},"reviewBody":"This was delicious, though I made a few alterations. Like others, I added more herbs (thyme, rosemary, herbs de Provence, Basil, ground all spice). I chopped up the onion & along with a few table spoons of oil and tomato paste,I microwaved it with the herbs in a bowl for about 1 minute on high (a trick I learned from Cooks Illustrated slow cooker recipe book) & then I added this mixture to the pot at the start of step 2 above. Cooked the meat much longer, a/b 5 hrs before adding veggies."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Fast Marty"},"reviewBody":"save money and use beef chuck instead of ribeyes/filets.  get an intact chuck roast from the butcher, not pre-cubed \"beef for stew\".  Cut the meat up yourself into small cubes.  Ribeyes are for grilling, or broiling, not stew.  The collagen breaks down nicely and the chuck meat transforms wonderfully. Of course, if you're wealthy, do as you wish."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sheerah"},"reviewBody":"Loved this. Doubled the wine & reduced the beef broth.

Over hours of simmering, all the flavors meld together and the ingredients soften to tenderness.</p><p><b>How to Thicken Beef Stew:</b> Starches, like the flour and potato in this recipe, thicken beef stew. Here, beef cubes are coated in flour, then browned, leaving flour in the pan while sealing flour to the meat. When the meat is later simmered, that flour thickens the liquid as do potatoes, which release their starches as they cook.</p><p><b>How to Make Beef Stew on the Stove:</b> It's important to cook stew slowly over low heat. High heat will cause the meat to tighten and toughen, while low heat allows the meat to become fall-apart tender.

She's gone now, but I would give anything to eat this with her one more time.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 667</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Lisa Conn</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">6 years ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">This was delicious.  I cubed a chuck roast which was cheap and flavorful (removing all excess fat).  I added some worchestershire sauce and ketchup at the end to add umami (flavor). After cooking I separated the solids and boiled the liquid a bit to reduce and concentrate, then whisked in a slurry of flour and water to thicken before recombining with meat and veggies.  This stew is a one pot meal.

Cooked the meat much longer, a/b 5 hrs before adding veggies.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 229</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Fast Marty</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">4 years ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">save money and use beef chuck instead of ribeyes/filets.  get an intact chuck roast from the butcher, not pre-cubed "beef for stew".

I want to try a vegetarian version with vegetable broth, rutabaga or parsnips, peas, and maybe butternut squash — would prob add vegan Worstershire for the deeper flavor that meat gives + a roux to thicken.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">JP in CO</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">6 days ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">I made this stew a 2nd time for a large family dinner last night. The 1st time, followed the recipe exactly. In my opinion, this is a fine basic stew but needs additions to prevent it from tasting bland. For the 2nd iteration, I tripled the recipe for our group. For a more robust sauce, after browning the beef batches and deglazing the pan, I included 2 teaspoons of worcestershire sauce and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of thyme to the liquids. Instead of raw onion, I caramelized it first.
