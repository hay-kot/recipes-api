        "text": "Add 3 big handfuls of kosher salt to a large pot of water and bring to a boil. (You're probably tired of us saying it all the time, but, yeah: Salting your pasta water generously is the key to well-seasoned pasta, period.) Drop 1 lb. small shells into boiling water and give them a good stir to be sure nothing sticks. Set a timer according to package directions for al dente."

        "text": "While pasta is cooking, heat 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 tsp. freshly ground pepper in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted and foaming, but not browned, and pepper is fragrant, about 1 minute."

        "text": "Add 1 cup whole milk to butter to stop it from browning and bring to a simmer. Whisk remaining 6 Tbsp. butter into milk mixture 1 Tbsp. at a time, allowing each to fully melt before adding the next. (Doing this gradually is important\u2014it helps to emulsify your sauce.) You may need to adjust your heat occasionally to maintain a simmer. If pasta still needs a few more minutes to cook, turn off heat under your sauce, cover pot, and keep warm."

        "text": "Add about one-third of grated Parmesan, stirring pasta vigorously with wooden spoon to melt. Add about \u00bd cup reserved pasta water and continue to stir until combined. Repeat this process 2 more times with remaining Parmesan. You may not need all of the pasta water, so add \u00bd cup at a time until pasta is very creamy and well coated. It\u2019s always good to err on the side of looser (with a little extra pasta water) because the sauce will thicken as it cools. Give it a taste and add more salt, if needed."
