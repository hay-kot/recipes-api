    "description": "Inspired by classic Eastern European cabbage rolls, this super-cozy bake takes a leaf\u2014or layer, if you will\u2014out of the lasagna handbook. Blanched cabbage leaves are layered with spiced beef rag\u00f9 and lemony herbed rice for a casserole chock-full of all the flavors of cabbage rolls, without the actual rolling. There are two tricks to the perfect cabbage roll casserole (no mushy rice or soggy bottoms here!). First, reducing the sauce so the tomatoes reach a thick, almost paste-like consistency. The second is parboiling the rice (as you would for tahdig or biryani) and sprinkling it lightly between the layers giving it room to cook to fluffy perfection while baking.",

        "text": "Heat oven to 400\u00b0. Start by prepping the beef filling. Coarsely chop 1 large bunch dill (you should get about \u00be cup), then crush and finely chop 3 large garlic cloves. Transfer a third of dill and a third of garlic to a large bowl. Add 1\u00bd lb. ground beef or plant-based meat, 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be kosher salt, and \u00bd tsp. freshly ground black pepper and mix with your hands to incorporate. Set remaining dill and garlic aside separately."

        "text": "Heat 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high until shimmering. Add half of beef mixture, dropping into pot in small clumps. Cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned underneath, about 5 minutes (or about 3 minutes if using plant-based meat). Stir and continue to cook 1 minute (it\u2019s okay if the meat is not fully cooked through, it\u2019ll finish cooking in the sauce). Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a plate. Repeat with remaining beef mixture. Wipe out pot."

Cook onion, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until softened and starting to turn golden, 6\u20138 minutes. Add \u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, \u00bc tsp. ground cinnamon, and reserved garlic, and cook, stirring, 30 seconds."

Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is cooked off and mixture is just a little looser than tomato paste, 20\u201325 minutes."

        "text": "While the sauce is cooking, line a large rimmed baking sheet with kitchen towels and bring a medium pot of generously salted water to a boil. Using a paring knife, cut about 1\" deep circle around core of 1 large head of savoy or green cabbage. Remove core, then gently pull off 16\u201320 cabbage leaves, cutting away from core if needed. (Save any extra cabbage for another use.) Cut a small V in the bottom of each leaf, about \u00bd\" big, to remove the thickest part of the fibrous stalk. Working in batches of 3\u20134 leaves at a time, cook cabbage until just pliable, 10\u201315 seconds. Transfer to prepared baking sheet with tongs. Pat leaves dry."

Let cool 10 minutes before serving.\nDo ahead: Meat sauce can be made, rice can be parboiled, and cabbage leaves can be blanched 3 days ahead. Cover and chill separately.
