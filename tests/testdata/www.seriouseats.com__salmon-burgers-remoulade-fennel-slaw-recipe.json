  "description": "Most salmon burgers fail to deliver on their promise, but not these: These are tender and juicy with a crispy, crunchy exterior that yields to medium-rare deliciously seasoned salmon within. Served on soft toasted brioche buns that are spread with a creamy r\u00e9moulade sauce and topped with a fresh fennel and radicchio slaw, the potential of a salmon burger has finally been realized.",

    {
      "text": "For the Salmon Patties: In a medium bowl, combine salmon, herbs, coriander seeds, and ginger. Stir well, then season with salt and pepper. (You can cook a very small amount in a nonstick skillet to check salt levels, and then adjust accordingly). Set in refrigerator."
    },
    {
      "text": "For the R\u00e9moulade: In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, capers, cornichons, herbs, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and horseradish until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to refrigerator."
    },
    {
      "text": "For the Slaw: In a medium bowl, combine celery root, radicchio, and fennel. Drizzle with just enough olive oil to coat and sprinkle with lemon juice to taste. Set aside."
    },
    {
      "text": "For Cooking and Serving: Spread panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl or pie plate, and arrange a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Divide salmon mixture into 4 even portions and, working one at a time, roll each into a ball, then flatten into a 1-inch thick patty, using your hands to smooth out any cracked edges (they may squirm around on you a little, but keep at it and they'll come together)."
    },
    {
      "text": "Place each patty in the bowl of bread crumbs, use your hands to sprinkle more bread crumbs on top, then press down gently to make bread crumbs adhere to the bottom side. Flip patty and press gently once more, then transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining salmon."
    },
    {
      "text": "Add oil to a large cast iron skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully lower salmon patties into the oil and cook, turning once or twice, until lightly browned on both sides and medium-rare within (about 115 to 120\u00b0F or 46 to 49\u00b0C on an instant-read thermometer), about 10 minutes; adjust heat as necessary to keep things sizzling without scorching the bread crumbs."
    },
    {
      "text": "Transfer patties to a paper towel-lined tray and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Smear an even layer of r\u00e9moulade on the top and bottom halves of each bun. Set a salmon patty on top of each bottom bun. Season slaw with salt and pepper, then mound some on top of each patty. Close sandwiches and serve right away."
