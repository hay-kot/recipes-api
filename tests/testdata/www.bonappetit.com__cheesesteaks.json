Either way, don\u2019t stress; whatever you do will be more than fine.) Divide meat into 8 portions (about 8 oz. each), using sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap as dividers."

(Or use a large cast-iron skillet and cook 1 portion at a time.) Lightly coat griddle with oil. Place 2 portions of meat (about 1 lb.) on griddle; season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, pressing down and pulling slices apart using 2 metal spatulas, until halfway cooked through (you should still see some raw spots). Scoot meat into 2 oblong portions no more than 1\" high and top with some onion\u2013bell pepper mixture. Top with 2 slices American cheese and 2 slices provolone cheese per pile. Cook, undisturbed, until meat is browned and crisp underneath and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer each portion to a roll; slice in half crosswise. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve topped as desired."
