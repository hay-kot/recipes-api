Cook, stirring often at first then only occasionally as vegetables soften, adjusting heat as needed and adding a splash or so of water if vegetables are browning too quickly, until golden brown and very tender, 25\u201330 minutes."

      "text": "Cut short ribs in half crosswise, then lengthwise into very thin slices. (It\u2019s better to have thinner, less-regular slices than thick, even slices. Either way, don\u2019t stress; whatever you do will be more than fine.) Divide meat into 8 portions (about 8 oz. each), using sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap as dividers."

      "text": "Slice bread in half lengthwise, keeping a long side intact. Heat a large griddle across 2 burners over medium\u2014a flick of water should sizzle on contact. (Or use a large cast-iron skillet and cook 1 portion at a time.) Lightly coat griddle with oil. Place 2 portions of meat (about 1 lb.) on griddle; season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, pressing down and pulling slices apart using 2 metal spatulas, until halfway cooked through (you should still see some raw spots). Scoot meat into 2 oblong portions no more than 1\" high and top with some onion\u2013bell pepper mixture. Top with 2 slices American cheese and 2 slices provolone cheese per pile. Cook, undisturbed, until meat is browned and crisp underneath and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer each portion to a roll; slice in half crosswise. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve topped as desired."
