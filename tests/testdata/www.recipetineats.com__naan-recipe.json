    "description": "Recipe video above. This is a recipe for naan bread that's fluffy, bubbly and chewy, just as it should be. Nobody will ever mistake this for just another basic flatbread! Perfect for slopping up your favourite Indian curries \u2013 yet so good that you'll happily devour it plain, straight out of the skillet.Bearing in mind that we aren't cooking in nuclear-level 480\u00b0C hot tandoors, see in post for background notes on how I find this recipe to most closely replicates restaurant naan. Makes: 6 naans, ~15-16cm / 6 - 7\" diameter. For more Indian recipes, browse the Indian collection.",
