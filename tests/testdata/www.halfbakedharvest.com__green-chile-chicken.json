      "text": "1. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0 F. 2. Slice the chicken through the middle horizontally to within a 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book. Spread the cream cheese on 1 side of the chicken, then add the pepper jack and a few poblano pepper slices. Fold the other side of the chicken over the peppers/cheese, like a book, to enclose the filling. Place the chicken in the skillet or baking dish. Rub with olive oil. 3. In a small bowl combine the chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the chicken. 4. Sprinkle the remaining poblano peppers and onions around the chicken. Drizzle everything with olive oil, then pour over the salsa verde. Bake 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Serve with fresh cilantro and limes."
