In a blender or food processor, combine the red peppers, walnuts, tomatoes, garlic, parsley, olive oil, vinegar, honey, 1 teaspoon paprika, cayenne, and a generous pinch of salt. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. 2. Set a large pot or skillet with sides over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon paprika, and a pinch each of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until golden brown, 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup manchego, cook another minute, then remove the chicken from the pot.3. To the same pot, pour in 3 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, add the pasta, and cook, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente, 8 minutes. Do not drain the pasta water. If needed, add additional water to help the pasta cook. 4. Stir in the roasted red pepper sauce (you may not need it all), manchego, and basil. Toss until very creamy and heated through. Slide in the chicken and any juices left on the plate.5. Serve the pasta topped with fresh manchego and arugula. Enjoy!"
