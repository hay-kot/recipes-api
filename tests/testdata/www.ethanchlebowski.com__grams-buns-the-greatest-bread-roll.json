Add in the softened butter and work the butter into the dough until it\u2019s completely incorporated about 5 minutes. Once incorporated, sprinkle some flour on the work surface and turn the dough out. Flatten the dough a bit and fold it into the center. Flip the dough over and shape it into a ball by tightening and pulling against the work surface. The dough should feel light, soft, and smooth. Place back in the bowl and cover. Let rise until doubled in size, about 60 to 90 minutes."

Form them into a ball by tightening and pulling on them on the work surface (see video for additional shaping options). Place on a greased baking sheet and cover.
