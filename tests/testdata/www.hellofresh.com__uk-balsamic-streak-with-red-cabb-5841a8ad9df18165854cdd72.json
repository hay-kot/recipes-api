  "description": "Cabbage, potatoes, and cranberries may conjure images of New England and boiled dinners, but this recipe brings in some more worldly flair. The sauce that adorns the steak has splashes of balsamic vinegar and soy sauce for a mash up of Italian and Asian-inspired flavors. Plus, the potatoes are roasted with rosemary until fragrant and the cabbage is given a boost from tangy white wine vinegar.",
