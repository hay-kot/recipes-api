Pick up edges and allow dough to slump down into dish, letting excess dough hang over dish. Trim, leaving about a 1\" overhang. Fold overhang under; pinch and crimp. Chill 30 minutes."

      "text": "Line dough with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving some overhang. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until crust is dry around the edges and just beginning to brown, 25\u201335 minutes. Carefully remove parchment and weights and reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0. Brush inside of crust (not the crimped edges) with 1 large egg, beaten to blend, and continue to bake until crust is set and beginning to lightly brown in the center, 10\u201315 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 1 day ahead; tightly wrap and store at room temperature."

Pour into cooled crust. Bake pie until edges are set and slightly puffed but center is recessed and wobbles like Jell-O, 60\u201375 minutes (it will continue to set after baking). Transfer to a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours before slicing. Serve with whipped cream.\nDo Ahead: Pie can be baked 1 day ahead; tightly wrap and chill. Serve warm or at room temperature. You can also freeze pumpkin pie up to 3 months in advance.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This recipe was first printed in November 2016 as part of BA\u2019s Best, a collection of our essential recipes.
