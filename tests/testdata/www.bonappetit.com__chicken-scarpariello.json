Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced and you can no longer smell the alcohol, about 8 minutes.

Nestle chicken into onion mixture, then transfer skillet to upper rack of oven and roast chicken 10 minutes. Add sausages to skillet, pushing them into onion mixture, and continue to roast until chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0, 5\u201310 minutes."
