        "text": "In a large bowl, whisk 3 cups of flour, yeast and salt. Stir in water and enough remaining flour to form a moist, shaggy dough. Do not knead the dough. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a cool place until doubled, seven to eight hours."
      },
      {
        "text": "Move an oven rack to the center and preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Place your Dutch oven on the center rack to preheat for at least 30 minutes. Be sure to keep the lid on the Dutch oven as it preheats, allowing heat to gather inside the vessel. Once the Dutch oven is heated, turn the dough onto a generously floured surface. Using a metal scraper or spatula, quickly shape the dough into a round loaf. Rather than kneading, simply use the scraper to pull the dough under itself as you turn it. Gently place the rounded loaf on a piece of parchment."
      },
      {
        "text": "Using a sharp knife or a bread lame, make a slash across the top of the loaf. It should be 1/4-inch deep. Using the parchment, immediately lower the dough into the heated Dutch oven. Cover and bake the bread for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Partially cover the loaf if it browns too much. Remove the loaf from the pan and cool completely on a wire rack."
