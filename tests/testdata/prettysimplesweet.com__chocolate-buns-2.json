      "text": "Place flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer and mix until combined, then stir in salt. Attach the dough hook and add water, milk, and butter. Mix on low-medium speed until dough comes together, 2-3 minutes, then continue mixing for another 7 minutes, until dough is soft and elastic and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add chocolate chips and keep kneading for a few more seconds until combined."
